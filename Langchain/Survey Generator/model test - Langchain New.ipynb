      "Answer Jamming out on my guitar, hitting the gym for a solid workout, and playing video games until late at night.\n",
      "Answer Creative projects at home like woodworking and crafting unique pieces of furniture—it's a tangible sense of achievement. Long motorcycle rides clear my head, man. Also, volunteering brings a different perspective to life; it's humbling.\n",
      "Answer Combination of both.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewing person 3 with traits: Men being currently employed\n",

      "\n",
      "Interviewing person 4 with traits: Men being currently employed\n",

      "Answer Well, let me see... Fixing up old motorcycles until they purr just right – there's a certain pride in reviving a beast. Next, gotta say it’s those small moments watching sunsets on my porch; somehow, they never get old. And lastly, cooking up a feast for family and friends – love seeing their faces light up with that first bite.\n",
      "Answer I'm at my best making a mean chili for friends; spice and laughter, a perfect mix. Plus, creating tunes on my synth - that's where I unleash my inner Mozart. Then, chess in the park, where every move is like a battle of wits, y'know?\n",

      "Interviewing person 5 with traits: Men being currently employed\n",

      "Answer I'm drawn to painting landscapes because there's something deeply gratifying about capturing the essence of nature on canvas. Tinkering with vintage radios, the nostalgia and the challenge keep me hooked. Plus, evenings strumming my ukulele under the stars just fills me with peace.\n",

Getting lost in a masterpiece of a book, I live for those moments where I can disconnect from reality. I also cherish those tranquil morning jogs; the solitude is priceless.\n",

      "Answer They're like an escape pod from the 9 to 5 grind. When I'm cruising on my Harley, it's just me and the open road, no deadlines, just freedom. Flipping through dusty vinyls at the local shop, every crackle's like a trip back in time. Plus, my Saturday kitchen experiments? Who knew that a pinch of saffron could teleport you to another continent?\n",
